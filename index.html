            <p class="title-text">
                For the second half of my 8-month co-op as a Student Consultant at the University of Guelph, I embraced
                more challenging responsibilities and had the opportunity to mentor new co-op students. This allowed me
                to develop leadership skills and tackle complex problems, improving my technical expertise and
                adaptability. Through these experiences, I deepened my understanding of IT systems and strengthened my
                ability to collaborate effectively with the team. This also gave me valuable insights into the
                importance of communication and teamwork in IT support.
